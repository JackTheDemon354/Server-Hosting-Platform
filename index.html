<ul>
<li>
<strong>As a folder</strong>: Ensure the world folder contains essential files like <span class="wysiwyg-underline">level.dat</span> and <span class="wysiwyg-underline">region folders</span>.</li>
<li>
<strong>As a .zip file</strong>: Alternatively, compress the entire <span class="wysiwyg-underline">folder</span> into a<span class="wysiwyg-underline"> .zip</span> file, including all subfolders and files.</li>
</ul>
